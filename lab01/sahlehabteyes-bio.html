        <p> Hello,</p>
        <p>My name is Ruhama Sahle. I am a senior at the iSchool majoring in Information Management and Technology with concentrations in Information Security Management and Web Design and Management.
        Despite the two concentrations, I am leaning more so towards web design mainly because of a UDEMY course that I took this summer. I loved seeing code turn into something almost in real time (assuming the code worked of course..). 
        It was exciting and really sparked my creativity. I am, therefore, quite excited to focus on the front-end aspects of web design during this class this fall.</p>

        <p>I have had a decent amount of exposure to the base languages of web design: html, css, and javascript. I have especially enjoyed working with react and javascript. 
        I wish to improve my skills in all things web design so as to wield them with confidence.</p>

        <p>Outside of school, a main focus of mine is poetry. I write mainly in my native tongue, Amharic, and I share some of the insights I accumulate as my life unfolds.
        Some topics are lighthearted, some are sincere- ultimately, it’s a record of the human experience.</p>

        <p>I enjoy collaborating with different creatives from different mediums with a dedication to their craft to create compelling and sincere final products. 
        It’s been an epic journey thus far and I’m beyond excited for the things to come.</p>

        <p>I am also an avid fan of BTS.</p>

        <p>Overall, I’m excited to be here and I’m excited to learn as much as I can! I truly hope this year will feel a bit more normal for us all.</p>

        <p>Ruhama</p>
