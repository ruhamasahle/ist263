        <h1>Ruhama's Biography</h1>
        <p> Hello,</p>  
        
        <p>My name is Ruhama Sahle. I am a senior at the iSchool majoring in <strong> Information Management and Technology</strong> with concetrations in Information Security Management and Web Design and Management.
        Despite the two concentrations, I am leaning more so towards web design mainly because of a UDEMY course that I took this summer. I loved seeing code turn into something almost in real time <em>(assuming the code worked of course..)</em>. 
        It was exciting and really sparked my creativity. I am, therefore, quite excited to focus on the front-end aspects of web design during this class this fall.</p>
        <p>I have had a decent amount of exposure to the base languages of web design: html, css, and javascript. I have especially enjoyed working with react and javascript. 
        I wish to improve my skills in all things web design so as to wield them with confidence.</p>
        <h2>I Exist Outside of School Too!</h2>
        <p>Outside of school, a main focus of mine is poetry. I write mainly in my native tongue, Amharic, and I share some of the insights I accumulate as my life unfolds.
        Some topics are lighthearted, some are sincere- ultimately, it’s a record of the human experience.</p>
        <p>I enjoy collaborating with different creatives from different mediums with a dedication to their craft to create compelling and sincere final products.<br>
        It’s been an epic journey thus far and I’m beyond excited for the things to come.</p>
        <p>I am also an avid fan of BTS.</p>
         <h2> Three of My Favorite Songs- they're always changing!</h2>
            <dl><dt>Black Swan</dt>
                <dd>From their Map of the Soul: 7 album, this song is a beautiful look into the fear 
                    and desperation that artists of any mediums encounter when they begin to lose love for 
                    what they do. The song is performed by all seven members of the band and as such reflects the 
                    fears that they all have about the amount of success they have doing what they love. 
                    As some members often say/insinuate, the brighter the light, the darker the shadow- with their increasing success came unanticipated hardships. 
                    The sincerity in their lyrics is the signature of the 
                    authenticity by which BTS carries themselves and, arguably,why they have 
                    amassed many fans around the world. They are not afraid to speak at the 
                    human level and be very frank. In turn, this sincerity has made
                    them a beautiful source of comfort and hope for many fans. 
                    Aside from the lyrics and meaning behind the song, the audio and performance is just as captivating- if not more so. I recommend
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtaP4UkZKyc"> this</a> live performance of Black Swan that they performed at the 2020 Melon Music Awards in Seoul, South Korea.
                    </dd>

                <dt>Interlude: Shadow</dt>
                    <dd>This song is a solo by my favorite member whose stage name is Suga. The title of the song and by extension, the title of the album, Map of the Soul: 7, is named after 19th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's Map of the Soul. This specific song is named <em>Shadow</em> after on of the archetypes of the human psyche articulated by Jung. The Shadow is a reference to a person's weaknesses and parts of themselves they would normally hide. In this Suga is discussing the shadows he struggles with. There is a podcast recorded about this song by a Chicago based podcast named Speaking of Jung where the creator, Laura London, speaks to different Jungian Analysts. In <a target="_blank" href="https://speakingofjung.com/podcast/2020/1/12/episode-53-shadow-interlude">episode 53</a>, London meets with none other than the author of the book Jung's Map of the Soul, Dr. Murray Stein himself, to speak about this particular song. Dr. Stein's book is globally famous for making Jung's work more accessible and is, at least, one of the reference books BTS used in the making of their albums. Stein's analysis of the songs and praise for the artists showcases the level of artistry they present and how dedicated they are to their craft. BTS are a big inspiration to me as a poet. </dd>

                <dt>Promise</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is a beautiful solo by another member named Jimin Park. It is his first solo and it is a song he wrote to himself as a way of promising to be kinder to himself. Jimin is known to be very critical of his every move and naturally, being in the public eye so much only exasperates how much he scrutinizes everything about himself as he strives for perfection. In the process however, Jimin reveals in this song that he has not been as kind as he could be to himself. Loving yourself is something BTS have sang extensively about and have released a triology of albums by the names LOVE MYSELF: HER, TEAR and ANSWER. Ultimately, BTS  also launched a campaign in November of 2017 in partnership with the Korean and Japanese committees for UNICEF to spread the message of the importance of loving yourself. The song is a beautiful reminder of this campaign and yet another sincere and open account of Jimin's own struggles and his journey in overcoming them. I recommend listening to Promise sitting outside by the trees in the afternoon. I think this time of year is the perfect weather too.

        <p>I hope you enjoyed my not-at-all-exhaustive list of favorite songs. Thank you for reading through it all if your did. I am excited to be here in this class and I am excited to learn as much as I can! I truly hope this year will feel a bit more normal for us all.</p>
